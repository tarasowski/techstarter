Part 1: Prepare for deployment

Install Fabric on your local development environment using pip install fabric.

Create a simple web application (e.g., a Flask or Django app) or use an existing one.

Set up a remote server where you can deploy the web application. Ensure that you can SSH into the server without a password (use SSH keys).

Create a Fabric script to automate the deployment process.

Part 2: Deploy the Application

Run your Fabric deployment script by executing fab deploy in your terminal.

The script will connect to the remote server, transfer your application code, install dependencies, and start the web application server.

Access the web application by using your remote server's IP or domain.

Document the deployment process, including any additional configuration or adjustments you made for your specific application.
