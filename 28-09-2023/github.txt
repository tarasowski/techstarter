**Title: GitHub User Search App**

**User Story:**

As a software developer, I want to find and explore the GitHub profiles of other users quickly. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. As a user, I should be able to enter a GitHub username in a search bar.

2. Upon entering a username and initiating the search, the application should fetch and display relevant information about the GitHub user, such as their profile picture, bio, location, and a link to their GitHub repositories.

3. If the entered username is not valid or does not exist on GitHub, the application should provide a clear and user-friendly error message.

4. The app should have a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to understand and use.

5. Each displayed result should be clickable, leading to a detailed view of the selected GitHub user's profile and repositories.

6. The application should be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. Users should have the option to explore multiple GitHub profiles in a single session without the need to reload the page.

8. The app should handle potential errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages in case of network issues or API failures.

**Definition of Done:**

- The GitHub User Search App is functional and allows users to search for GitHub profiles.
- The app displays relevant information about the searched user.
- The app provides clear error messages when necessary.
- The user interface is intuitive and responsive.
- The app is free of major bugs and errors.
