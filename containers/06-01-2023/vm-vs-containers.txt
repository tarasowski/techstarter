Virtual Machines (VMs):

1. Isolation: VMs are like running multiple computers within a single physical computer. Each VM has its own operating system (OS), which is completely isolated from the host OS and other VMs. This isolation provides strong security boundaries between different VMs.

2. Resource Overhead: Because each VM has its own OS, VMs are relatively heavyweight in terms of resource usage. They consume more memory and storage space due to the duplication of OS components.

3. Boot Time: VMs take longer to start because they need to boot a full OS. This can be a drawback if you need to spin up VMs quickly.

4. Compatibility: VMs can run applications from different OS environments, making them a good choice for legacy applications or situations where you need to run multiple OS types on the same host.

5. Hypervisor: VMs are managed by a hypervisor, which is a separate layer of software that controls the VMs' access to physical hardware.

Containers:

1. Isolation: Containers are like lightweight, isolated environments within a single OS. They share the host OS kernel but have their own file systems and process spaces. This provides a good level of isolation, but not as strong as VMs.

2. Resource Efficiency: Containers are highly efficient in terms of resource usage because they don't require a full OS for each container. They share the host OS components, which reduces memory and storage overhead.

3. Boot Time: Containers start almost instantly because they don't need to boot a complete OS. This makes them suitable for dynamic and rapidly changing workloads.

4. Compatibility: Containers are best suited for applications that are designed to run in the same OS environment. They are excellent for modern, microservices-based applications.

5. Container Engine: Containers are managed by a container engine (e.g., Docker), which is a single piece of software responsible for running, building, and managing containers.

- VMs are like having separate, full-fledged computers running on a single physical machine, providing strong isolation but with higher resource overhead. 

- Containers, on the other hand, are lightweight, share the host OS, and offer efficient resource utilization.
